# Exploring Bayesian Prior Distributions for Relative Risks in Epidemiology

Relative risk is a common, and often preferred measure of association in epidemiology and clinical studies. In this project, we discuss some common prior distribution choices for relative risk. Then we choose a subset of prior distributions to perform a simulation to examine whether the true relative risk value was recovered accurately and compare the estimates to non-Bayesian methods.
